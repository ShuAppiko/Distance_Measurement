Files for project "Distance measurement using VL6180X sensor"

In this project we measure a small distance from 5mm to 100mm using VL6180X optical sensor with Arduino Pro Micro and display the output on an OLED display.
We used a 128x64 1.3" OLED graphical display with SSD1306 controller IC.
I2C protocol is used for communicating the sensor and OLED with Arduino Pro Micro, which operates at 5V, 16MHz.
